        <p class="title">How to get started as a freelance developer</p>
        So, you’re thinking of becoming a freelancer? Well, DUH! .. the freedom, flexibility and the chance to pick your own projects sounds like the dream! But where do you even begin? If you’re staring at your screen, unsure of how to transition from a full-time job or from coding as a hobby into the wild world of freelancing, I hope this post serves as a decent starting point.<br><br>Let me walk you through how I got started, what I’ve learned over the years, and how you can get going as a freelancer. Spoiler: it’s not all rainbows and glamorous remote work sessions by the beach, but with the right approach, hopefully you will be up and running in no time.<br><br><img src='cover.jpg'></img><br>

        <br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> Hone your skills before you start selling them</p><br><br>Before you even think about freelancing, make sure your skills are on point. I’m talking about a solid foundation in your tech stack; whether that’s JavaScript, Python, Swift, or whatever language you're most comfortable with. Freelancing is extremely competitive, and you’re not just competing against junior devs; you’re also up against mid-level and senior professionals with solid portfolios. Freelancers don’t get the luxury of an onboarding process or extensive team support, you need to be self-sufficient from day one. In fact, in most cases, it'll be up to you to explain project concepts and details to your client. You should be very comfortable with the idea of your client sending you some source code (if any), some images (if any) and some requirements in your lab, and it is up to you to figure out the rest.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16px'> Start Small, Practice Big</p><br><br>You don’t have to know <i>everything</i> about programming to start freelancing, but make sure you are good at something specific. Maybe you're a whiz with backend APIs, or maybe you’ve got a knack for making gorgeous frontends, or maybe you're the best systems architect the world is yet to see?. Whatever it is, practice it until you're confident you could do it in your sleep (but don’t, you’ll break things).<br><br>Example: Want to specialize in building APIs with PHP or Node.js? Here’s a quick checklist:<br><br>- Do you understand how to set up a basic production server?<br>- Can you design a RESTful API from scratch and implement them? Documentation anyone?<br>- Have you played around with GraphQL yet? Do you need to? Why?<br>- How’s your error handling and validation game?<br><br>It’s important to get good at something specific. Clients don’t want jack-of-all-trades; they want someone who can deliver <i>results</i>. The narrower your expertise, the easier it is to stand out. Let the know-it-all phase come naturally with experience and time, just make sure that whatever you tackle is always met with quality, confidence and an amazing customer experience.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> Build a Portfolio That Sells</p><br><br>Your portfolio is your digital résumé. In fact, it’s more than that—it’s your sales pitch. So, don’t just toss a few random projects up on GitHub and call it a day. Carefully curate a portfolio that highlights your strengths. A portfolio also speaks volumes of your character and personality type if it delivers the right impact.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16px'> Pick Projects That Showcase Your Skills</p><br><br>Your portfolio should tell a story. If you're into web developer, show off a slick, responsive web app. If you’re a backend person, display your API design skills with detailed documentation. And it’s not just about the code; make sure you explain your process behind each project. Why did you choose a particular technology? How did you solve specific problems? Or if you wore many hats during a certain project, a brief on each role!<br><br>Here's a simple checklist for portfolio projects:<br><br>- A <b>simple project</b> that shows clean code and good structure.<br>- A <b>medium-complexity project</b> that includes a database, API, or integration with a third-party services.<br>- A <b>large project</b> (even if it’s just hypothetical) that demonstrates your ability to manage complexity, like a basic e-commerce platform or a SaaS-style app. This can be the best way to show off your system design skills and knowledge with the best contemporary technologies.<br><br>Tippy-tip: If you don’t have many real-world projects yet, don’t panic. You can build demo projects on your own time, search for ideas or use AI tools for ideas. You wouldn't believe how many good ideas are out there just waiting to be implemented. Just make sure they’re relevant and well-documented.<br><br><img src='1.jpg'></img><br>

        <br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> Learn the Business Side of Freelancing</p><br><br>Here’s the thing no one tells you when you start freelancing: you're not just a developer anymore. You’re a business. That means you’ve got to learn some businessy stuff.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16px'> Pricing Your Work</p><br><br>Figuring out what to charge is tricky. Charge too little, and you’ll burn out working for pennies. Charge too much, and potential clients might run for the hills. Here's a simple formula to get started:<br><br>1. <b>Figure out your baseline hourly rate</b>: Take what you want to make annually, divide by the number of working hours per year (usually around 2000 hours), and that’s your base hourly rate. Hold on! This won't be what you charge just yet.<br><br>2. <b>Add in taxes, expenses, and downtime</b>: You’ll need to charge more than your base hourly rate because as a freelancer, you're responsible for your own health insurance, retirement savings, and time off. Additionally, depending on where you work or how your business entity takes form, you probably need to factor in taxation.<br><br>So, let’s say you want to make $80,000 per year.<br><br>Baseline hourly rate = $80,000 / 2,000 = $40/hour.<br><br>Now, add another 25-30% to account for taxes, expenses, and downtime. That brings you up to about $50-$55/hour.<br><br>But wait; there’s more! If you're freelancing through platforms like Upwork or Fiverr, they’ll take a cut of your earnings too, so factor that in. If a platform for instance takes 20% form your earnings, factoring this in will bring up your hourly rate to around 65$.<br><br>However, you still need to consider the current market and not offer rates higher than the average, in fact, on platforms, you usually need to start with a slightly lower rate than like-experienced peers in order to have a competitive edge.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16px'> Contracts Are Your Friends</p><br><br>Contracts protect you and your client. Even if you're doing a job for a buddy (many, many buddyhoods are ruined this way), write up a simple contract outlining what you are doing, how much you are charging, and when the payment is due. It doesn't have to be fancy, just clear.<br><br>Things to include in your contract:<br><br>- Project scope: What exactly are you delivering?<br>- Payment terms: How much and when? Can you match deliverable milestones with installments?<br>- Timeline: Deadlines, milestones, etc.<br>- Ownership of the work: Who owns the code when it is done?<br>- Specifics: Is your backend code running on a server? Who sets up the server? Who's responsible if the production server is not up to par with your apps min requirements <- This is a very real problem that for some reason devs/clients fall into all .. the .. time!!<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> Find Clients Without Going Crazy</p><br><br>Okay, now for the million-dollar question: Where do you find clients? When you are just getting started, this can be the hardest part. You will hear a lot about platforms like Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr. They’re not bad, but as previously mentioned, it may require you to start with lower rates than the market which can -and many times make- you end up in a race to the bottom on pricing. So, I suggest looking beyond the obvious channels.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16px'> Networking and Referrals</p><br><br>Your first clients are likely going to come from people you know. Reach out to your network. let friends, family, and former coworkers know you are available for freelance work. You’d be surprised how many gigs you can land just by word of mouth.<br><br>Also, don’t be afraid to ask for referrals from happy clients. If you did a killer job on someone’s app, ask if they know anyone else looking for a developer.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16px'> Social Media and Communities</p><br><br>X (previously Twitter) and LinkedIn are goldmines for networking. Follow industry leaders, engage with their content, and don’t hesitate to slide into a few DMs (professionally, of course). Share your work, post useful content, and show off your expertise.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16px'> Freelancing Platforms</p><br><br>While they are not my favorite, freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr can be good places to get your feet wet. Just be cautious about under or overpricing yourself.<br><br>Tipsies: When you’re using these platforms, focus on niche projects. Do not compete with the masses by applying for generic “build my website” or “Get an app in 3 days” jobs. Instead, go for specialized projects where you can stand out. It's paramount to think of the type of client you want to work with and usually, clients looking for a niche service have more knowledge and focus on what they want.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> Keep Learning and Growing</p><br><br>Freelancing is a journey, and there is always something new to learn. whether it's a new framework, how to price your services better, or how to manage your time effectively. Stay curious, keep evolving, and you <i>will</i> thrive.<br><br>And finally, don't be too hard on yourself if things don’t go perfectly at first. Always remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Freelancing has its ups and downs, and that’s part of the ride. But if you keep pushing forward, learning from every experience, and improving your craft, you'll carve out your place among the GOATs.<br><br>So, ready to get started?    </div>
