        <p class="title">Balancing multiple freelance projects at once</p>
        Being a freelancer has its perks. You get to be your own boss, set your schedule, work on projects you're passionate about; sounds like a dream, right? Well, not always. It's usually true that the more benefits a job -any job- has, the more challenging it is to get into and maintain.<br><br>Once you start racking up clients and multiple projects at once, that dream can quickly turn into a logistical nightmare. Balancing multiple freelance projects may seem a bit tricky. But with a little strategy and the right mindset, you'd better believe that you are capable of doing what you may have thought impossible one day.<br><br><img src='cover.jpg'></img><br>

        <br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 22px'> 1. Get Comfortable with Saying "No"</p><br><br>First thing’s first: You need to learn to say <i>NO</i>, And that can be tough, especially when you’re starting out as a freelancer and every client seems like a golden opportunity. But the truth is, taking on too much work is a fast track to burnout, missed deadlines, and <i>a lot</i> of stress.<br><br>Here’s an easy rule of thumb: **if you’re already busy, don’t take on new projects unless they’re 10x better than what you’re doing now.*&#8226; Why? Because that’s the only way you’ll truly value them. However, this doesnt mean punishing your current projects by setting them aside in favour of a new valuable one.<br><br>If you’re the type who tends to over-commit, you might want to start getting comfortable with politely declining new work. A simple "I'd love to work with you, but I’m fully booked at the moment. Let’s keep in touch for future projects" will do wonders. Trust me, it’s a lot better than taking on too much and dropping the ball later. In fact, some clients -who tool the time to research- will be well prepared to wait for you to be available or book you in advance.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 22px'> 2. Prioritize Ruthlessly</p><br><br>Alright, now that you’ve got your projects lined up, it’s time to prioritize. Not all deadlines are created equal, and not all clients have the same level of urgency.<br><br>Start by identifying which projects have the highest priority. These are the ones with upcoming deadlines, big payoffs, or long-term client relationships at stake. Focus on those first.<br><br>Here’s a simple system I use:<br><br>1. <b>Urgency</b>: What’s due soon?<br>2. <b>Impact</b>: Will completing this project open more doors (or wallets)?<br>3. <b>Difficulty</b>: How long will it take me to finish this? Is it a quick win?<br><br>Since I'm a big fan of Kanban boards; I like setting up boards for each project and drag tasks based on priority. However, a simple to-do list app will surly suffice.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> Example:</p><br><br>Let’s say you’re juggling three projects: a mobile app for Client A, a simple landing page for Client B, and an API integration for Client C.<br><br>Client A’s app has a hard deadline in two weeks. The landing page for Client B is flexible, and Client C is kind of waiting on you, but they haven’t been too pushy. Your priorities might look something like this:<br><br>1. <b>Client A: Mobile App</b> (High urgency + high impact)<br>2. <b>Client C: API Integration</b> (Low urgency, medium impact)<br>3. <b>Client B: Landing Page</b> (Low urgency, low impact)<br><br>By assigning importance to tasks based on both urgency and potential rewards, you’ll find yourself working smarter, not just harder.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 22px'> 3. Master Time Blocking</p><br><br>If there’s one thing that’s a game-changer for managing multiple projects, it’s time blocking. Instead of trying to multitask, which, let’s be real, does not actually work for most of us (if not sometimes even detrimental), you dedicate specific blocks of time to specific projects.<br><br><b>How does this help?</b> Simple. Your brain doesn’t have to constantly switch gears, which means you are more focused, more productive, and less likely to make mistakes. When you know you’ve got three hours set aside for Project A and another two for Project B, you get laser-focused during those blocks.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> How to Set Up Your Time Blocks:</p><br><br>1. <b>Assess Your Availability</b>: Look at your schedule and figure out when you have chunks of uninterrupted time.<br>2. <b>Break Down Tasks</b>: Don’t just block out "work on project." Be more specific. Say "design home page," "code login functionality," or "write API tests."<br>3. <b>Be Flexible</b>: Things come up—be ready to adjust your time blocks if needed, but stick to the plan as closely as you can.<br>4. <b>Be particular</b>: It will eventually happen that a time-block will be interrupted by something else Practice to your greatest effort to make sure that a block is dedicated fully to the planned task.<br><br>Let’s imagine you’ve got a typical workday from 9am to 6pm. Here’s how time blocking might look for a busy day juggling two freelance projects:<br><br>- <b>09:00 - 12:00am</b>: Project A (Focus on user authentication module)<br>- <b>12:00 - 01:00pm</b>: Lunch Break<br>- <b>01:00 - 03:00pm</b>: Project B (Finish landing page design)<br>- <b>03:00 - 05:00pm</b>: Project A (Bug fixes and testing)<br>- <b>05:00 - 06:00pm</b>: Respond to emails, project reviews, and plan next day’s work.<br><br>Notice how there’s clear time dedicated to each project (and task)? That’s the key. Don’t bounce around trying to do a bit of everything—you’ll just end up doing a whole lot of nothing.<br><br><img src='1.jpg'></img><br>

        <br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 22px'> 4. Manage Client Expectations</p><br><br>This one’s huge. A lot of freelancers get caught up in trying to keep their clients happy at all costs, but that can quickly backfire if you over-promise and under-deliver.<br><br>Be realistic about deadlines, and do not be afraid to negotiate timelines if you’ve got too much on your plate. Most clients will appreciate honesty upfront rather than a half-baked project down the road. Make sure to practice non-technical client communication to be able to explain why things take the time and effort they do, without using technical jargon that only you understand.<br><br>Here’s a formula for managing expectations effectively:<br><br>1. <b>Be Transparent</b>: If a project is going to take two weeks, don’t say one. Padding your deadlines gives you a buffer for any unexpected surprises and gaps in your own understanding / knowledge.<br>2. <b>Provide Updates</b>: Regular updates go a long way in building trust with clients. Even if you haven’t made much progress, checking in shows that you are on top of things as well as allow your client to adjust their own plans if necessary.<br>3. <b>Under promise and Over deliver</b>: Set realistic expectations and try to deliver ahead of schedule when possible. It’s better to wow your client by finishing early than to apologize for delays. Mastering this one skill if enough to create an unshakable relationship with your client.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 19px'> Example:</p><br><br>You’re working on two web projects, and one client asks for a delivery date. Instead of saying, “I’ll have it done by Friday” and stressing yourself out, say, “I’ll need until next Wednesday to complete it,” and if you finish by Monday, you’ve just exceeded expectations. Boom! Instant brownie points.<br><br><p style='margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 22px'> 5. Take Breaks, Seriously</p><br><br>When you’re juggling multiple projects, it’s easy to fall into the trap of working non-stop. But here’s the deal: breaks aren’t optional; they’re essential.<br><br>Ever notice how after a couple of hours of grinding, your brain just feels... foggy? That’s your cue to take a break. A quick 5-10 minute walk, some stretching, or even just standing up and moving around can clear your mind and help you come back more focused.<br><br>If you’re on a tight deadline and don’t feel like you have time for a break, here’s what I do: <b>Pomodoro Technique</b>. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). It seems simple, but it works.<br><br><hr><br><br>Remember, freelancing is a marathon, not a sprint. Burnout is real, but with a bit of organization and a lot of discipline, you can thrive in this fast-paced world without sacrificing your sanity. While Balancing multiple freelance projects is no easy feat, always remember that with the right approach, it’s completely manageable. Just always make sure to not forget to take care of yourself.    </div>
